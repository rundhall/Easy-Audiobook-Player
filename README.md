## Assembly
### Hardware
1. **Connect Components**: Use a custom PCB or breadboard for wiring the Arduino Nano, DFPlayer Mini, and amplifier board.
2. **Enclosure**:
   - Drill holes for the speaker, button, and cable entry.
   - Mount all components securely in the wooden box.
3. **Power Supply**: Feed the USB power cable through the enclosure and connect to a 5V charger.

### Software
#### Preparing MP3 Files
1. Place your audiobook MP3 files into a `mp3_files` folder.
2. Use the provided Python script (`mp3_to_mp3chunks.bat`) to split files into 5-minute chunks.
3. Copy the output files to the `01` folder on a FAT32-formatted SD card.

#### Programming the Arduino
1. Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) in Visual Studio Code.
2. Clone the repository and open the `EasyAudiobookPlayer_Arduino` project.
3. Update the `platformio.ini` file to match your Arduino Nano configuration.
4. Upload the code to the Arduino Nano using PlatformIO.

## How It Works
- **Playback**: The Arduino controls the DFPlayer Mini to play audio files stored on the SD card.
- **Amplification**: The audio signal is amplified and played through the speakers.
- **Power Management**: A DC-DC converter steps up voltage for the amplifier, while the Arduino and DFPlayer operate on 5V.
